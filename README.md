## The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a database for the three-dimensional structural data of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.

### To download file:

Type in the name of your protein of interest --> download files --> pdb format

## SRA Database

The Sequence Read Archive (SRA, previously known as the Short Read Archive) is a bioinformatics database that provides a public repository for DNA sequencing data, especially the "short reads" generated by high-throughput sequencing, which are typically less than 1,000 base pairs in length.

### To download file:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6802966/ --> Data Availability --> SRA database --> enter SRA id --> open run --> copy experiment --> enter in download tab (fastq) --> download sra file

OR 

### Use fastq dump
